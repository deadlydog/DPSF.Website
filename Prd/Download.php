<!-- Version Specific Highlights go here -->
<h3>Highlights to versions 2.3.0 (XNA 4) - September 30, 2012</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Particle systems can now support multiple Emitters! So rather than using multiple of the same particle system, just use one particle system with multiple emitters. Huge performance improvement!</li>
    <li>Initial support added for Mono For Android, to support using DPSF on Android devices though the use of Mono. Still working some bugs out though.</li>
    <li>Totally refactored the DPSF Demo to make it easier to follow and the pieces more reusable.
    <li>Minor bug fixes and features added.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="ChangeLog.php">full change log and download older versions of DPSF here</a>, including XNA 3.1 compatible versions.</p>
