<p>The official legalese version of the <a href="license_%28eula%29.htm#officialeula">DPSF End User License Agreement (EULA)</a> can be found further down, but directly below is a brief description of the EULA in simple English. &nbsp;In the event of any discrepancies between the simple and official EULA, the official EULA will take precedence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Simple EULA Description</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conditions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DPSF is free to use in your applications, whether they are free or commercial for profit.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">All released games/products must mention DPSF somewhere in the product.</span> &nbsp;This may be through the provided DPSF splash screen particle system (players may skip the splash screen by pressing a button), displaying the DPSF logo (image), or simply mentioning DPSF in text. &nbsp;Both the DPSF logo and splash screen particle system can be found in the DPSF Logos directory (typically C:\DPSF\Logos). &nbsp;If you are only mentioning DPSF in your product's credits, then the credits should be accessible from the main menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Redistribution</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You may redistribute DPSF to others for them to use in their projects, as long as you do so by redistributing the DPSF installer itself. &nbsp;This ensures that the end-users receive all DPSF related files (e.g. dll files, help documentation, tutorials and demos, etc.) and that they agree to the DPSF EULA included in the installer before using DPSF.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Official EULA<a name="officialeula"></a></span></p>
