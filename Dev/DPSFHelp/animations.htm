<p>DPSF provides an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Animations</span> class that may be used to easily store the texture coordinates of separate images stored within a single texture. &nbsp;NOTE: Because the particle systems only store a single texture, all of the frames of an animation must stored in a single texture (image file). &nbsp;This method is used over storing each frame in a separate texture because texture swapping is very expensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Animations class uses two central concepts: a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Picture</span> and an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Animation</span>. &nbsp;A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Picture</span> can be thought of as a frame of the animation, except that it can be used in multiple spots throughout the Animation. &nbsp;An <span style="font-weight: bold;">Animation</span> is simply a sequence of Pictures used to make up the animation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pictures can be created using the CreatePicture() function, where you supply the texture coordinates of the texture that should be used for the picture's image. &nbsp;If the images are arranged in a nice grid fashion in the texture, you can use the CreatePicturesFromTileSet() function to easily create all of the pictures to use in the animation. &nbsp; So each Picture that you create will have a unique ID, and will hold the texture coordinates that should be used to display that picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Animations can be created using the CreateAnimation() function, where you supply the sequence of Picture IDs that should make up the animation. &nbsp;You must also supply how long of a pause there should be (in seconds) between switching pictures, so the shorter the pause between switching pictures the faster the animation will be played. &nbsp;The same delay is used for switching between all pictures; if you want one picture to be shown longer than the others, then put it in the picture sequence twice in a row. &nbsp;The last parameter that you must supply is how many times the animation should play before stopping. &nbsp;If this is set to one the animation will play only once, two will make it loop and play twice, etc. &nbsp;Setting this to zero will cause the animation to loop forever and never stop playing. &nbsp;Each Animation created is assigned a unique ID, and you may specify which animation should play by setting the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CurrentAnimationID</span>.</p>
