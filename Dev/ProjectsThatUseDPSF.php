<p><span class="Quote">"Firebase Industries used DPSF for almost every particle effect in the game. We also found it was the easiest solution for anything that required rendering with smooth translucency and as a result the holographic force shields that are infront of the ship bay are actually quad particles instead of scene geometry. The same technique was used for the two quad particles that make up the boost gate hologram.<br />The integration with the Sunburn Engine was simple and straightforward and the support Daniel gave us was fantastic! When we needed a specific effect such as the trail rendering behind the player's ship he was there to help us out!"</span>

<p><span class="Quote">"HoloPhone3D v1.5 uses DPSF for all my particle effects. DPSF was an awesome find and it fit the bill perfectly. The samples were great, the API was simple and the helps docs were fantastic. Overall, I couldn't of asked for a better particle system to integrate into my app....The main places where DPSF was used are in the mini-game sections. I used it for torches and the warp goal in all my marble maze dungeons and I used it in the "Asteroid Attack" mini game for the 180 degree 3D starfield, touch input, earth shield and asteroid explosions."</span>

<p><span class="Quote">"At Haiku Interactive we used DPSF on our latest release, AvaGlide. The thermals that players can use to gain altitude are depicted using DPSF particles. We also used DPSF to create small wisps of cloud that pass the player by in order to enhance the feeling of movement and for particles at the glider wingtips. We found DPSF very easy to use and will no doubt be using it in future projects."</span>

<p><span class="Quote">"It's a mash up of a shmup/rhythm game. You hit timed button presses to the beat of the music to attack enemies but you still have control of your own ship that you have to navigate around obstacles.<br />So far we're using DPSF for bullets, missile trails, explosions, ship exhaust, powerup particles, etc. Still working on them but love this easy to use particle system."</span>

<p><span class="Quote">"We've been working on it as often as we could for the last three years and have finally brought it to a release point. There are a billion things that we wanted to do with it but there's only two of us and if we hadn't limited our ambitions we'd have kept going for another 20 years. Our hope is that people enjoy what we've done so far and that we'll get a chance to continue the series. There are so many places we can take it! All feedback is welcome!
<br />
A special thanks to Daniel for his awesome particle system and always being there to respond to questions and calls for help! Siege King has quite a few effects that use his system."</span>

All Your Creeps (which released in January for XBLIG) uses DPSF, and made my life much simpler. Thanks for such a great tool!</span>
