<h1>Download DPSF</h1>

<p>The DPSF installer contains the assemlies (i.e. dlls), setup manual / help file (includes tutorials and source code),
    templates to start from, and
the DPSF Demo solution showing how to create many different particle systems. If you only want the assemblies, they are available on Nuget.</p>

<!-- Version Specific Highlights go here -->
<h3>Highlights to versions 2.5.0 (XNA 4) - August 31, 2013</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed Android bug where IndexOutOfRangeException would be thrown on some Android devices, depending on their hardware capabilities.</li>
	<li>Added SetEnabledStateForAllParticleSystems(), SetVisibleStateForAllParticleSystems(), and SetEnabledAndVisibleStatesForAllParticleSystems() functions to the ParticleSystemManager class.</li>
	<li>Added new DisabledWithEarlyRecycling memory management mode to allow recycling the oldest active particle when we want to add a new particle, but have no more memory available for it.</li>
	<li>Added new DPSFDebugWarningExceptions that are only thrown when debugging and are meant to help users catch when they do not have DPSF setup ideally.</li>
	<li>Created iOS friendly DPSF assemblies, but still not fully tested due to lack of Mac hardware required for testing.</li>
	<li>Fixed performance bug in ParticleEmitterCollection, as it was generating garbage for the Garbage Collector every time the Emitters and IDs properties were accessed (impacted Xbox greatly).</li>
</ul>
