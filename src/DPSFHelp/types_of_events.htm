<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr valign="top"><td align="left">
<p>There are four types of events: <a href="types_of_events.htm#everytimeevents">Every Time Events</a>, <a href="types_of_events.htm#onetimeevents">One Time Events</a>, <a href="types_of_events.htm#timedevents">Timed Events</a>, and <a href="types_of_events.htm#normalizedtimedevents">Normalized Timed Events</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Every Time Events<a name="everytimeevents"></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every Time Events are events that fire every time the particle system's <span style="font-weight: bold;">Update()</span> function is called, and they persist until they are explicitly removed. &nbsp;Every time events are executed on every active particle in the particle system. &nbsp;Examples of events that you would want as every time events are things like updating a particle's position according to its velocity, or interpolating between a particle's start and end colors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">One Time Events<a name="onetimeevents"></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One Time Events are events that fire once as soon as they are added, and then they are automatically removed and will never fire again. &nbsp;One time events are executed on every active particle in the particle system. &nbsp;Examples of events that you would want as one time events would be things such as changing to particle's velocity when the user presses a button, or making the particle system react to some other game event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timed Events<a name="timedevents"></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timed Events are events that are set to fire at a specific time. &nbsp;Both particle systems and particles have an <span style="font-weight: bold;">ElapsedTime</span> property which tells how long the particle or particle system has existed for. &nbsp;While the particle's ElapsedTime property is available with the rest of the particle's properties, the particle system's ElapsedTime property can be found in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ParticleSystemEvents.LifetimeData</span> property. &nbsp;So if you want an event to fire after the particle system has existed for 5 seconds, you could create a timed event with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">TimeToFire</span> of 5.0 to accomplish this. &nbsp;Timed particle events are only executed on the particles that have just reached the specified TimeToFire, and they only fire once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Normalized Timed Events<a name="normalizedtimedevents"></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normalized Timed Events are similar to timed events, except that instead of using the ElapsedTime property, they use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">NormalizedElapsedTime</span> property which is always between 0.0 and 1.0. &nbsp;The NormalizedElapsedTime property is calculated by the equation ElapsedTime / Lifetime, where the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lifetime</span> is the amount of time the particle or particle system is set to exist for. &nbsp;So if you want an event to fire halfway through a particle's Lifetime, creating a normalized timed event with a TimeToFire of 0.5 would accomplish this.</p>
