<h1>License (EULA)</h1>

<p>
The official legalese version of the DPSF End User License Agreement (EULA) can be found further down, but directly below is a brief description of the EULA in simple English.  In the event of any discrepancies between the simple and official EULA, the official EULA will take precedence.
</p>


<h2>Simple EULA Description</h2>



<h4>Conditions</h4>


<p>
DPSF is free to use in your applications, whether they are free or commercial for profit.  All released games/products must mention DPSF somewhere in the product.  This may be through the provided DPSF splash screen particle system (players may skip the splash screen by pressing a button), displaying the DPSF logo (image), or simply mentioning DPSF in text.  Both the DPSF logo and splash screen particle system can be found in the DPSF Logos directory (typically C:\DPSF\Logos).  If you are only mentioning DPSF in your product's credits, then the credits should be accessible from the main menu.
</p>




<h4>Redistribution</h4>


<p>
You may redistribute DPSF to others for them to use in their projects, as long as you do so by redistributing the DPSF installer itself.  This ensures that the end-users receive all DPSF related files (e.g. dll files, help documentation, tutorials and demos, etc.) and that they agree to the DPSF EULA included in the installer before using DPSF.
</p>
